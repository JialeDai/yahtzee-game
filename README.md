## About the game
This is a dice game implemented by java using  swing and sockect. This is a relatively simple game to learn and involves 5 dice 1 player. In a round, the player takes a turn. On each turn, the player rolls the dice with to get them to one of the 13 categories listed. If the first roll doesnâ€™t fulfill one of the categories, the player may choose to roll any or all of the dice again. If the second roll fails, the player may roll any or all of the dice again. By the end of the third roll, however, the player must assign the final dice configuration to one of the thirteen categories on the scorecard. If the dice configuration meets the criteria for that category, the player receives the appropriate score for that category; otherwise the score for that category is 0. Since there are thirteen categories and each category is used exactly once, a game consists of thirteen rounds. After the thirteenth round, all players will have received scores for all categories. The player with the total highest score is declared the winner.

### Loading Game
To retrieve a saved game, the client should send a request to the server. The servers should send a list of games indexed by player name and time saved. When the user selects a game, it sends the request to a server, the server receives the requests, gets the data from a database, marshalls it into an object, and sends the object back to the client. \
